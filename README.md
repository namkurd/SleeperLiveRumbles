# DTF Club — Rumbles Live Standings

A live, gameday-updating standings page for the league's custom "Rumbles"
scoring system, served straight from GitHub Pages. Separate project from
the career head-to-head matrix -- its own repo, its own data, its own
page.

## The Rumbles formula

For each week:

- **+9 Rumbles** for winning your scheduled head-to-head matchup
- **+1 Rumble** for every *other* team in the league you outscore that week

In a 12-team league that's up to **20 Rumbles in a single week** (9 for the
win, 11 for having the top score league-wide). Rumbles accumulate over the
season and reset every year.

This was verified line-by-line against the real "2026 TRUE STANDINGS"
Google Sheet for Week 1 and matched exactly for all 12 managers.

## How it works

`build_rumbles.py` runs on a daily GitHub Actions schedule. For every
fully completed week of the current season, it pulls final scores from
Sleeper, computes each manager's Rumbles/PF/PA/H2H W-L/Vs.-Field W-L, and
commits the cumulative totals to `rumbles_history.json`.

`rumbles.html` is the live page itself. It loads `rumbles_history.json`
for everything already finished, then computes the current, in-progress
week entirely client-side -- polling Sleeper directly every 30 seconds, no
backend involved.

### Columns

Rank, Manager, Rumbles (labeled **Actualized Rumbles** or **Projected
Rumbles** depending on the mode toggle -- see below), This Week (Rumbles
earned so far this week), Points This Week (the raw score for this week,
to 2 decimal places), Rumble % (Rumbles earned / max possible so far), PF,
PA, H2H W-L, and Vs. Field W-L. On a narrow screen the table scrolls
horizontally (Rank and Manager stay pinned) rather than squeezing or
clipping any column.

The standings table always shows the season's cumulative numbers -- it's
never blank. Outside of a live window (off game days, or the gap between
one week ending and the next one's games starting) it's just
`rumbles_history.json` as-is, no LIVE badge. Once a week goes live, "This
Week" and "Points This Week" refresh every 30 seconds with a LIVE badge no
matter which mode is selected. Whether the in-progress week's numbers get
folded into the season totals -- Rumbles, H2H W-L, PF, PA, and Vs. Field
W-L, all five -- depends on the mode toggle, described next.

### Live scoring: two modes

While a week is in progress, `rumbles.html` fetches every starter's actual
stats and Sleeper's projection for them directly in the browser, on every
30-second poll. Every number is scored by dot-producting a stat line
against the league's real `scoring_settings` -- never Sleeper's generic
`pts_ppr`/`pts_std` fields, which are a *different* scoring system
(standard PPR/standard scoring) that won't match a league with custom
rules like this one's first-down bonuses and tiered defense scoring. This
was verified directly against Sleeper's own displayed matchup projection:
summing a team's starters through this exact formula reproduced Sleeper's
own number to the penny. (Sleeper's own projections update continuously
throughout the week as its model reruns, sometimes by a lot in a short
window -- so a snapshot comparison against Sleeper's site will only match
exactly at the instant both are captured; drift a few minutes later is
expected, not a bug.)

- **Actual** (default on page load) -- ONLY real, actually-banked stats.
  Never touches projections. This is the fully "solidified" view: Rumbles,
  H2H W-L, PF, PA, and Vs. Field W-L are ALL locked to whatever's already
  final in `rumbles_history.json` -- none of them fold in the in-progress
  week's actual-score outcome yet, since it can still flip right up to the
  final whistle (a team's actual PF, for instance, will legitimately sit
  at **0** for anyone who hasn't kicked off, or whose whole roster is
  still pregame -- that's correct, not a bug). "This Week" and "Points
  This Week" keep showing that in-progress figure live regardless, they
  just never get added into the season totals until the week is actually
  over and the workflow finalizes it.
- **Projected** -- matches the live number Sleeper itself shows on its own
  matchup page: once a player's game is underway, their actual performance
  so far replaces their frozen pregame projection; anyone who hasn't
  started yet still uses Sleeper's projection. This mode DOES fold the
  in-progress week's numbers -- Rumbles, H2H W-L, PF, PA, and Vs. Field
  W-L -- on top of the cumulative totals, so you can see where the season
  stands if the week ended right now.

Completed weeks (from `rumbles_history.json`) aren't affected by the
toggle -- it only changes how the live, in-progress week is scored.

(An earlier version of this page also had a third "Generic PPR" / "Sleeper
Projection" mode using Sleeper's precomputed `pts_ppr` field, and a third
"Our Custom Scoring" label for what's now just "Projected". The PPR mode
was dropped: this league isn't PPR-scored, so that number could never
match what Sleeper's own site shows, no matter how precisely it was
displayed -- it was just a different scoring system. What's now called
"Projected" is the one that actually reproduces Sleeper's own number.)

## Files

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `build_rumbles.py` | Computes and writes `rumbles_history.json` for every fully completed week of the current season. Standalone -- discovers the league and manager names straight from Sleeper's API each run. |
| `rumbles.html` | The live standings page. Self-contained (no build step, no server) -- just needs to be served as a static file next to `rumbles_history.json`. |
| `rumbles_history.json` | Generated by `build_rumbles.py` -- don't hand-edit it. Doesn't exist until the workflow has run at least once. |
| `.github/workflows/update.yml` | Runs `build_rumbles.py` on a daily schedule and commits `rumbles_history.json` when it changes. |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependency for `build_rumbles.py` (just `requests`). |
| `test/` | A mocked end-to-end test of `rumbles.html` (see below) -- optional, not needed to run the site itself. |

## Setup

1. **Create the repo.** Push these files to a new GitHub repo (e.g.
   `dtf-club-rumbles`).
2. **Check the league settings at the top of `build_rumbles.py`:**
   `FALLBACK_LEAGUE_ID`, `FALLBACK_USERNAME`, and `DISPLAY_NAME_OVERRIDES`
   (for anyone whose Sleeper display name isn't what you want shown).
3. **Enable GitHub Pages:** repo Settings -> Pages -> Deploy from branch ->
   `main` / root.
4. **Trigger the workflow once manually** (Actions tab -> "Update Rumbles
   standings" -> Run workflow) so `rumbles_history.json` gets created for
   the first time.
5. **Confirm the page loads** at
   `https://<you>.github.io/<repo>/rumbles.html`.
6. **Embed it** in the Google Site: Insert -> Embed -> By URL, pointing at
   that URL, on its own page.

## Testing without live Sleeper access

`test/make_fixtures.py` builds mock Sleeper API responses, and
`test/run_test.py` runs a headless-browser end-to-end test of the real
`rumbles.html` against those mocks, across three scenarios:

1. **A week genuinely live** -- hand-verified PF checks across both
   scoring modes (Actual / Projected), including a fully-pregame
   roster to confirm Actual correctly shows the frozen history PF while
   Projected still shows a real, nonzero folded number, and a check that
   every manager gets two genuinely distinct totals (proving the modes
   never bleed into each other).
2. **Cumulative-only** -- Week 1 is final in `rumbles_history.json`, but
   Sleeper's own `state.week` pointer hasn't rolled over yet and Week 2's
   matchups aren't posted. The page must show Week 1's cumulative
   standings, never a blank table.
3. **`rumbles_history.json` fails to load** -- the page must show a clear,
   diagnosable message instead of a silent blank table.

Useful if you ever touch the scoring or live-detection logic and want to
check it without waiting for a live NFL window:

```bash
pip install playwright
python -m playwright install chromium
python test/make_fixtures.py
python -m http.server 8123 &   # serve the repo root
python test/run_test.py
```

## Source of truth

For now this is a supplemental gameday view -- keep updating the "2026
TRUE STANDINGS" Google Sheet by hand. Eventually this page is meant to
replace that manual process, but that's a future step.
